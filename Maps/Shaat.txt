In the Egyptian outpost at Shaat you will face a fierce band of Hyksos who have found refuge in the Kushite city of Kerma.  Pharaoh has chosen you as the most capable of defeating these rogue invaders -- a task which must be completed before Shaat can hope to prosper. Your best hope of defeating the fearsome Hyksos is to make good use of the mighty chariot.  After rebuffing years of attacks from the Hyksos, respond to Kerma's request for troops to stamp out the Hyksos' threat once and for all.

The people who are brave enough to live in Shaat should be rewarded for enduring attack after attack.  Conditions in the city should be posh enough to result in one Palatial Estate.  You also need to build a large obelisk to remind citizens of Egypt's glory and to declare Egypt's dominance to the Hyksos.  

By the way, you might notice that the game will say that four Palatial Estates are needed to win.  Because the game counts each tile of a Palatial Estate separately, this really means that only one Palatial Estate is needed.
