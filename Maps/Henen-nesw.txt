"Henen-nesw"
Pepy II has ruled Egypt for some 90 years and, like the old Pharaoh, the government is showing signs of crumbling.  As the leader of Henen-nesw, you have designs on Egypt's throne. 

To prove your worthiness, quickly build an exemplary city at Henen-nesw, teeming with 10,000 people.  Provide enough of the sweeter things in life to earn a Culture Rating of 60 and a Prosperity Rating of 70 and to allow for the development of one Palatial Estate. The rest of Egypt looks upon you with wary eyes, distrustful of your intentions.  Lull them into a sense of security by responding to their every whim, earning a Kingdom Rating of 100.  Crown your fine achievement by building three monuments, a Mausoleum, a Large Stepped Pyramid and a Small Stepped Pyramid.  Quickly complete your goals, and prove to the country that you would make a much finer ruler than those upstarts at Waset.

As you build your city at Henen-nesw, you find yourself being threatened by your enemies, the Libyans.  To add to your difficulties, bloodthirsty Bedouin soldiers lurk to the west of the city.  The rest of Egypt is concerned about your Pharaonic ambitions and will carefully watch your actions.  If you appear to be a threat to them, they will push to cut you off before you have an opportunity to grow.
