"Empire"
The perils of the civil war are over, and your family has triumphed.  You rule Egypt with an iron fist, and many cities cower under your great authority.  Some of these cities will provide you with the valuable wood you need to construct your magnificent Pyramid Complex in your new capital at Itjtawy.  You should acknowledge their obedience by helping them in their times of need.

Other cities, however, chafe under your rule.  On, Khmun and Waset will rise up against you.  Be prepared to strike them down if they rebel.

Itjtawy should offer just enough of the finer things in life to keep people in the city.  Your ratings goals are: Culture Rating of 30, Prosperity Rating of 40, Kingdom Rating of 40 and population of 5000.  Be forewarned: if you do not accomplish these goals quickly, trouble could arise.
