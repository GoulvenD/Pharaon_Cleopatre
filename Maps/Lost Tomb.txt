Lost Tomb of the Pharaoh

Egypt is a shining star amidst a land of savages.  Any enlightened individual can clearly see that Egypt's achievements outshine all others and this is surely due to divine providence from the gods themselves.  But there are those who prefer to live as animals rather than rise to their divinely assigned status.  Thieves and villains plunder the tombs of your forefathers despite their most carefully laid out designs.  Pharaoh does not wish his afterlife to be disturbed and has wisely chosen to construct his monument away from the eyes of the greedy jackals that would violate a consecrated tomb to profit their own contemptible existence.

Pharaoh wishes his burial place to be somewhat more modest, and therefore less attractive to rogues, than his forebears.  He has chosen you to build a mausoleum deep inside the carved caverns of the living rock itself.  Workers have completed the hollowing out of a suitably sized chamber deep within a network of caves.  You are now to finish the project by building Pharaoh's eternal resting place.

You will be responsible for getting all needed supplies into the cavern and constructing the mausoleum, no small task.  Pharaoh will also make good use of your operation to ensure a steady supply of copper to the kingdom.
