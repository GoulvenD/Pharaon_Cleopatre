Small Oasis
Pharaoh has ordered you to build a settlement at Farafra Oasis. In this arid land you must build a prosperous city, build large Mastaba tombs, and supply Pharaoh with all that he asks for (Pharaoh especially likes the local pottery, bricks, and wood). The only problem is that the Oasis is rather small. Your citizens will need the water that the oasis supplies, wild game inhabit the grassy areas, fertile meadows lie nearby, and valuable trees surround the oasis. It will take careful city planning to use the oasis to its fullest.
