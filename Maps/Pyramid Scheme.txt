Pharaoh is confused.  He has mistaken your oasis town of Farafra for a granite producing city and is requesting granite from you for the construction of obelisks at Iken.  In order to avoid humiliating Pharaoh by pointing out his mistake, you must fill his request in a timely fashion.  Of course, this is all in addition to the fact that you are constructing a mausoleum and a pyramid for him...  Use your knowledge of trade and manufacturing to satisfy the needs of Pharaoh.
