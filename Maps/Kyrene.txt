What is this desolate wasteland whither you have been sent by Pharaoh?  Legends of Libyan riches are false and the supple coast of which Pharaoh's messengers spoke is nothing but a rocky wasteland.  Pharaoh has tasked you with establishing a prosperous port here, yet only with the help of the gods will you be able to succeed.  Where is the copper that made the strong Libyan weapons?  Where are the fertile pastures spoken of as legendary?  Who are the mysterious Sea People threatening to invade your shores?

Show respect for the gods in times of need: build temple complexes to celebrate their power and they will help you through your times of trouble.
