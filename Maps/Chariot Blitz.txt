Empire Expansion

The Egyptian kingdom is now well established but Pharaoh wishes to continue its expansion.  You are to establish a city for the purpose of creating weapons to aid Pharaoh's armies in this endeavor.  As a reward for this undertaking you may also construct a modest pyramid for yourself.  Look to Egypt's many settlements if you should require anything that the land does not provide.

Be warned though, Egypt's accomplishments have not come without some resentment from its inferior neighbors and their jealousy has sparked a call-to-arms against many Egyptian outposts.  It would be wise to raise an army as quickly as possible.  The enemy attacks may be frequent and could come from any direction!
