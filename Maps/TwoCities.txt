"A Tale of Two Cities"

Pharaoh's ability to rule is waning in his advanced years.  Governmental infrastructure has become increasingly disorganized.  Cities that once depended on leadership and trade from the capital are striking out on their own to acquire what they need.  Some of these cities will call upon your city for assistance. 

Helping your neighbors will open new trade routes.  But beware, as Pharaoh's power wanes, some communities will become bolder and greedier, and they may try to extort you.  However, one city will prove to be an ally, and will provide you with gifts of valuable copper in exchange for military support.

If you can protect your sister city, you can form an alliance to quash these treasonous cities and bring peace to the region.  By then, trade with a new city will be available.  This new route will provide you with the granite you need to build an obelisk in the ailing Pharaoh's honor.
