Egypt's dominance has spread across the Mediterranean, and you have decided to personally oversee the establishment of Enkomi in Cyprus.  Enkomi will be one of the most beautiful cities in the Egyptian empire, replete with all the luxuries of Egyptain life.  Conditions in the city must be good enough for ten Palatial Estates to be established.  You must also mark the territory as Egyptian by building three obelisks.  

While you are busy in Enkomi, people on the Egyptian mainland grumble about your absence.  Some claim you have forgotten your priorities.  As Egypt impatiently awaits your return, usurpers eye the throne of the land with increasing intensity.  Complete your tasks in Enkomi as quickly as possible so that you can return to Egypt and reaffirm your power.  If you linger too long in Enkomi, all will be lost...

By the way, you might notice that the game will say that 40 Palatial Estates are needed to win.  Because the game counts each tile of a Palatial Estate separately, this really means that only ten Palatial Estates are needed.
